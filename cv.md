<h3>About Me: </h3>
<p>The main goal in the work and the main motivator to continue to study
something new for me is the implementation of interesting projects.
When writing a program, I always want to pay attention to the readability 
of the code, its simplicity and, at the same time, multifunctionality.
I like to use my knowledge to solve unusual problems that allow me to come up
with something new or improve the old.
While working in a team, I really like to discuss the tasks set for the team
and options for solving them, to be present at the code review.</p>

<h3>Experience:</h3>
